## OpenSCAD to OpenJSCAD Translator

> Translates OpenSCAD syntax into OpenJsCAD syntax

## Overview

Node module that translates [OpenSCAD syntax](http://www.openscad.org/) into [OpenJSCAD syntax](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org/).

**_IMPORTANT NOTE:_ This project is written against an older version of OpenSCAD (v 2011.06) which has now been superseded.**

The following functions are not implemented (neither in csg.js nor in OpenJSCAD),
and contributions are welcome !

## Install

```
npm install @jscad/openscad-openjscad-translator
```

>NOTE: for now we need to use a temporary build of the sylvester (node-sylvester)
library since the one on NPM has a missing flag which makes use with browserify impossible:
see : [here](https://github.com/NaturalNode/node-sylvester/issues/9) and [here](https://github.com/NaturalNode/node-sylvester/issues/4)

## Usage

### Node

```javascript
  var parser = require('@jscad/openscad-openjscad-translator')
  var fs = require('fs')

  var openSCADText = fs.readFileSync("test.scad", "UTF8")
  var openJSCADResult = parser.parse(openSCADText)

  console.log(openJSCADResult)
```

### Web

```html
  <script src="../dist/web-built.js"></script>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    var text = document.getElementById('txt').innerText
    console.log(openscadOpenJscadParser.parse(text))
  </script>
```

Include ```lib/underscore.js``` and ```dist/web-built.js``` and the **openscadOpenJscadParser** object will be available.  This has two attributes:
* **parse** - a function which accepts OpenSCAD text and returns OpenJsCAD text.
* **parser** - a Jison parser object which can be used for more advanced parsing (e.g. the **parse** method returns the text and the context object, allowing for processing of *use* statements.)

## Build

### Web

not minified :
```
npm run build
```
minified:
```
npm run build-min
```
Creates scripts in the ```dist``` folder.

## Develop

### Jison

```
npm run build-parser
```
Compiles the Jison lexer/parser to an AMD module in the ```src``` folder called ```openscad-parser.js```.
