## Input Output format handling for the JSCAD projects

[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lernajs.io/)

## Overview

This repository includes all the input/output format handling for the JSCAD projects, and can also be used seperatly.

> NOTE : as of September 1 2018, we will NOT be accepting new PRS against the V1 / master branch: we realistically
are not able to keep adding new features/fixes to the 'old' version and work on the very different V2.
thank you for your comprehension !
(already open PRS at that date are exempt)

### Input Format Handling (deserializers)

ie: file data => jscad code (that can be evaluated to CSG/CAG)

> note : currently serializers & deserializers are NOT symetrical as deserializers
do not generate CSG/CAG objects: there is however work done to enable CSG/CAG output directly

deserializers with optional CSG/CAG output:

- [x] amf-deserializer
- [x] dxf-deserializer
- [ ] json-deserializer
- [x] obj-deserializer
- [x] stl-deserializer
- [x] svg-deserializer

Following formats are supported as inputs:
 - [AMF](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/amf-deserializer)
 - [DXF](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/dxf-deserializer)
 - [gcode](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/gcode-deserializer)
 - [JSON](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/json-deserializer)
 - [OBJ](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/obj-deserializer)
 - [STL (binary, ASCII)](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/stl-deserializer)
 - [SVG](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/svg-deserializer)

### Output Format Handling (serializers)

ie: CSG/CAG => blob

Following formats are supported as outputs:
  - [AMF](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/amf-serializer)
  - [DXF](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/dxf-serializer)
  - [JSON](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/json-serializer)
  - [STL (binary, ASCII)](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/stl-serializer)
  - [SVG](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/svg-serializer)
  - [X3D](https://github.com/jscad/io/blob/master/packages/x3d-serializer)

## Publishing

This is for owners/ managers of the repo only, obviously :)

It is done in semi-automated manner with Lerna & conventional-commits (semantic release)
It automatically checks out the `master` branch and pulls the latest version from the remote repo

In case of doubt, please ask @kaosat-dev for help

>you need to have npm & git authorization setup beforehand

- Do a dry run first !!

```shell
npm run publish-dryrun
```

then answer 'no' to avoid publishing to either git or npm

- when you are **SURE** everything is ok and you want to publish

npm run publish

>Note: DO NOT publish the packages individually and manually , unless you have very good
reasons to, and have discussed it with the rest of the team
