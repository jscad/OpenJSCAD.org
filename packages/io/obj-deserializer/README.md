> Deserializer for OBJ data to JSCAD geometries

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40jscad%2Fobj-deserializer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40jscad%2Fobj-deserializer)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jscad/io.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jscad/obj-deserializer)

## Overview

This deserializer converts raw OBJ formatted data (files) to JSCAD scripts or geometries.

**NOTE: At this time, only ASCII OBJ files are supported. BINARY OBJ files are not supported.**

This deserializer converts only what is supported by JSCAD libraries. Full document conversion is NOT supported, so don't even try. However, conversion of the following OBJ commands are possible:

| OBJ Command     | JSCAD Geometry | Notes |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| V               | to geom3     | vertices of polygons |
| F               | to geom3     | indexes to polygon vertices |
| G               | to geom3     | grouping of V and F to create polygons and geometry |

Also, if the 'USEMTL' (material) matches the name of a CSS3 color then the color is applied to the geometry.
