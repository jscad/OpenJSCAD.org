/**
 * Creates a matrix from a vector scaling.

 *     mat4.identity(dest);
 *     mat4.scale(dest, dest, vec);
 *
 * @param {mat4} out - the receiving matrix
 * @param {vec3} vector - X, Y, Z factors by which to scale
 * @returns {mat4} out
 * @alias module:modeling/maths/mat4.fromScaling
 * @example
 * let matrix = fromScaling([1, 2, 0.5])
