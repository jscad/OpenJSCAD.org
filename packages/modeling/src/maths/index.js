/**
 * Maths are computational units for fundamental Euclidean geometry. All maths operate upon array data structures.
 * Note: Maths data structures are considered immutable, so never change the contents directly.
 * @see Most computations are based upon the glMatrix library (glmatrix.net)
 * @module modeling/maths
 * @example
 * import { constants, line2, line3, mat4, plane, utils, vec2, vec3, vec4 } from '@jscad/modeling'
