# BREAKING CHANGES


## CSG/CAG Objects

  - removal of almost all methods
  TODO: list here 
  - no more boolean operations on the prototypes of CSG/CAG Objects !!
    ie this is valid const foo = union(a, b) 
    but this is not const foo = a.union(b)
  - CSG/CAG objects now have a .pipe() method
  to be able to chain operations on them using functions:
  ie benefit of functional approach while allowing chaining
  this is also in preparation for the day browsers & Node.js will
  support the > (pipe) operator 

### Math utilities & data structures:
 * vector3/3D is deprecated and replaced by vec3
  * not a class anymore, but a set of helper functions, that are also semi compatible with the stack.gl ecosystem
 * vector2/2D is deprecated and replaced by vec3
  * not a class anymore, but a set of helper functions, that are also semi compatible with the stack.gl ecosystem
 * matrix4 is deprecated and replaced by mat4
  * not a class anymore, but a set of helper functions, that are also semi compatible with the stack.gl ecosystem

## API

  - snake case methods are now camel case: ie chain_hull => chainHull
  - a SINGLE function per shape : no more CSG.sphere() vs sphere()
    - unified functions keep the openscad shortcuts, but also add more explicit ones
      - ie : h => height, fn => segments

### Booleans

  - no more implicit extrusions : ie union(2dShape, 3dShape) will not work anymore : you need to explicitely
  convert shapes before applying operations : ie extrude 2d shapes, or project/flatten 3d shapes

### Transformations

  - expand/contract is now only expand, with negative values for contract
  - rotate, translate, scale etc do NOT do implicit UNIONS anymore => array in, array out, single item item in, single item out

### Primitives

  - square => rectangle
  - circle => ellipse
  - triangle => GONE

  - cube => cuboid
  - sphere => spheroid ? (not sure about this one)

  - rectangle: now accepts either :
    * a size named parameter
    * a single numeric value (creates a square)
    * an array of numeric values 

    * center can be either a single boolean, a 2d array of booleans, or a 2d array of numeric values
      (for direct positioning)

### Extrusions

  - rectangular_extrude (basePoints, params) => rectangularExtrude(params, basePoints)
  - linear_extrude => linearExtrude
  - rotate_extrude => rotateExtrude
  - extrusions of 2d shapes with no edges (sides length === 0) will now throw an error
  - solidFromSlices(polygon, options) => solidFromSlices(options, polygon)

#### UPDATE !!

  after consideration, the naming convention will change to verbNound ie:
  - rectangular_extrude (basePoints, params) => extrudeRectangular(params, basePoints)
  - linear_extrude (basePoints, params) => extrudeLinear
  - rotate_extrude => extrudeRotate

  this makes it easier to find all related operations, and is coherent with some other naming
  conventions:
    - toXXX
    - fromXXX
    - measureXXX


### Colors

  - cut up into modules
  - a few helper functions have been renamed for correctness & clarity
      * rgb2Html => rgbToHex
      * hex2Html => hexToRgb
      * css2Rgb => colorNameToRgb
  
### Properties
  - there is no 'properties' class/ object anymore: not 100% sure
  - it is a simple array (Object??) attribute on parts/shapes

# Things to fix:

- rectangular_extrude's 'round' option was actually never used !! keep or remove
