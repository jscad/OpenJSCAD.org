# Contributor Code of Conduct

JSCAD is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community that thrives because our members, and you.

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

We are committed to providing such an environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude. Instead, teach and lead others to a better solution.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other members is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Offensive or vulgar language of any kind will not be tolerated.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, customers, or others, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the JSCAD administrators may take action, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Our Commitment

As contributors and maintainers of the JSCAD project, we pledge to respect all who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact anyone of the administrators of the JSCAD Project (See GitHub).
