  Running an App Engine server

This directory contains the files needed to setup the optional Blockly server.
Although Blockly itself is 100% client-side, the server enables cloud storage
and sharing.  Store your programs in Datastore and get a unique URL that allows
you to load the program on any computer.

To run your own App Engine instance you'll need to create this directory
structure:

blockly/
 |- app.yaml
 |- index.yaml
 |- index_redirect.py
 |- README.txt
 |- storage.js
 |- storage.py
 |- closure-library/  (Optional)
 `- static/
     |- blocks/
     |- core/
     |- demos/
     |- generators/
     |- media/
     |- msg/
     |- tests/
     |- blockly_compressed.js
     |- blockly_uncompressed.js  (Optional)
     |- blocks_compressed.js
     |- dart_compressed.js
     |- javascript_compressed.js
     |- php_compressed.js
     `- python_compressed.js

Instructions for fetching the optional Closure library may be found here:
  https://developers.google.com/blockly/hacking/closure

Go to https://appengine.google.com/ and create your App Engine application.
Modify the 'application' name of app.yaml to your App Engine application name.

Finally, upload this directory structure to your App Engine account,
wait a minute, then go to http://YOURAPPNAME.appspot.com/
