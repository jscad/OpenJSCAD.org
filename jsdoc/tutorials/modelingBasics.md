JSCAD is a solids modelling system. It is fundamentally unitless, however, when you export files, typically 1 unit is jscad corresponds to 1mm in your model file.

Modelling in JSCAD is often a case of building the shape you want out of primitives, but there are often many different options to get the same shape.  Check out the examples on the JSCAD app page to learn about the different capabilities.

### Adding Primitives

### Boolean Operations

### 2D to 3D

### Building with Polygons
